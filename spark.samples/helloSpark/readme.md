####Build a custom library for Apache&#174; Spark&trade; and deploy it to a Jupyter Notebook.

If you're new to developing Spark applications you've come to the right place. Our [**Start Developing with Spark** tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/start-developing-with-spark-and-notebooks/) provides detailed end-to-end steps that show you how to build a simple custom library for Spark (written in scala) and how to deploy it on IBM Analytics for Apache Spark for Bluemix. 

These steps are the foundation for building real-life production applications.  You'll also learn how to manage your project with the import, test, and debug features of Scala IDE for Eclipse.
